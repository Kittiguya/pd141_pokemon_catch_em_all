W00T ANOTHER README. TWO IN 1 WEEKEND LEETTS GOOOOOOO

Pretty simple, under poke_names change the values inside of the brackets to whichever pokemons number you are looking up. Itll pull the data.

Url takes the name, and uses the name parameter to place the of the pokemon which we have set in the list known as poke_names, 

Then we created a for loop outside the function (look at bottom), it then places the name of the pokemon inside {name} of the url.
